This is a score notation reader and scorer for the 2011
[Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org) competition game
_Tin Can Rally_.

The complexity of the game required a notation system which recorded
events as the game occurred, and as such the scorer treats the input
as a series of events from the game, and builds a score based on this
(rather than a more traditional game which is scored based on the
end-state).
